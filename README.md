# SmartPDF AI: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application  

## Overview  

SmartPDF AI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that lets you seamlessly interact with your PDF documents. It processes uploaded files, retrieves relevant information, and generates intelligent answers to your questions. Built on the LangChain framework, SmartPDF AI ensures efficient data handling and insightful conversational capabilities by leveraging modern embedding techniques and conversational models.

## Core Components of RAG  

SmartPDF AI follows the typical RAG application structure with two main workflows:  

### 1. **Indexing (Offline)**  
The indexing pipeline processes raw PDF data to create a searchable database of document chunks.  

- **Load**: Extract content from PDFs using document loaders (e.g., PyPDF2).  
- **Split**: Break the text into manageable chunks with LangChainâ€™s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. This helps optimize search and model input handling.  
- **Store**: Use a VectorStore (FAISS) to store these chunks after embedding them with a language model.

### 2. **Retrieval and Generation (Online)**  
At runtime, SmartPDF AI retrieves relevant indexed chunks based on user queries and generates context-aware answers.  

- **Retrieve**: Use a retriever to fetch relevant chunks from the vector database based on semantic similarity to the user query.  
- **Generate**: Pass the retrieved chunks along with the user query to a ChatModel/LLM (e.g., Gemini-pro) for answer generation.

## Features  

- **Efficient PDF Text Processing**: Extract and process text from multiple PDF files.  
- **Dynamic Question Answering**: Generate detailed and accurate answers to user queries.  
- **Seamless RAG Integration**: Combines offline indexing and online retrieval/generation workflows.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive user experience.  

## Usage  

1. Open the application in your browser (local URL provided by Streamlit).  
2. **Upload PDFs**: Use the sidebar to upload multiple PDF files.  
3. **Process PDFs**: Click **Submit & Process** to create an index of the PDFs.  
4. **Ask Questions**: Input queries in the main section and receive AI-generated answers based on the content of your documents.
